## APOD Webpage: Astronomy Picture of the Day

This project is a webpage inspired by NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) ([https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepixFull.html](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepixFull.html)). It displays the daily featured image or photograph of our universe along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.

### Features

- Displays the image, title, date, explanation, copyright, and a link to the high-resolution version (if available).
- Handles cases where no image data is found for the day.
- Implements a toggle button to switch between dark and light mode for better user experience.

### Inspiration

### Technologies Used
